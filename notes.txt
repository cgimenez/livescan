 i686-w64-mingw32-gcc has the following notes:
    If you want your MinGW-generated windows binaries to work under wine out-of-the-box
    (and they are not statically linked), you can instruct wine
    to automatically search for dll-s by running:
        wine regedit
    Nagivate to:
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment]
    or
        [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment]
    and add
        Z:\opt\local\i686-w64-mingw32\bin
    to the 'PATH' variable.
